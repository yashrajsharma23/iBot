# iBot 

Here, we have Jarvis the toddler bot to provide instant support to users

## How to Use this repo
- By running the code using the PyCharm

## About
As Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are now leading the world, making human life less complicated. However, there are many tasks that machine cannot handle and are still performed by human hands, but it can be accomplished by AI with the help of a chatbot. This approach is an innovative support in this time-oriented environment, since it does not require human involvement to solve the multiple queries asked by an individual, unless the concerns may not be out of box or context. The main objective of Chatbot is to be answering the queries by itself.

## Software
The packages we used to run the code in these tutorials are listed in [environment.yml](environment.yml).

To create a stand-alone environment named `project_name` with Python 3 and all the required package versions, run the following:

```bash
$ conda env create -n project_name -f environment.yml
```

You can read more about using conda environments in the [Managing Environments](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) section of the conda documentation.
